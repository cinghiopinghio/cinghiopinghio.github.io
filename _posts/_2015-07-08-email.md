With the occasion of changing machine (work location), I feel that's the
perfect moment to reorder my email fetching/reading/syncing process.

# Workflow

In this post I'll describe the workflow as I set it on my machines.
Every step will have it's own post in future (probably).

## Fetch emails

I've used `offlineimap` since some years now and I'm a bit disappointed on how
slow it may be and how dirty the configuration file ends up.
I started looking around and found 
[isync/mbsync](http://isync.sourceforge.net/).

## Tag Emails

notmuch

## Sync Emails

muchsync

## mail addresses

notmuch_address

## read/write

alot
