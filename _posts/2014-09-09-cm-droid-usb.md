i recently update to 10.1 and had the same problem and solve it using the procedure below
- turn off the optimus
- connect the USB cable to a PC (Linux in my case)
- press "G" , "VOLDOWN"  & "POWER"
- when the P970 starts , release "POWER", don't depress the other
- at the end of power on , the P970 is recognized as a mass storage (you can depress the button)
in my case , i think that a accidently press the G key during a restart in recovery mode, and
here are the linux message before reboot
