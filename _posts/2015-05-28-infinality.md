Today I've discovered a great piece of software,
[Infinality](www.infinality.net).

Since forever I'm a GNU/Linux user and fan. Some of you may use the word geek.
However, since I spend many hours in front of a screen, it's really important
to use an high quality, high DPI screen.

This lead me somehow to envy those freaking crisp mac screens, with their
fonts so damn defined... f**k I wanted one of those.

Until today!!!

Yes, after installing [Infinality](www.Infinality.net) in my laptop, all those
linux fonts become immediatly (even without any configuration) sharper and
nicer. Thats great. Try it.
